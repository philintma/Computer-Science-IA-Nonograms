# Computer-Science-IA-Nonograms
This is the Internal Assesment I am working on for my IB Computer Science class. I am creating a website (and possibly also an app) which creates nonograms based on a random picture from its database and allows users to solve them. It also allows users to log in to store the nonograms they have started but not finished solving.

Documents for each of the IA criteria (currently only accessible from @colegiovirgendeeuropa.edu.es google accounts):
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1shzRyQVO43-UxfNjywD_OKmFt_i1Kc33CYHd_fc_rwk/edit?usp=sharing - criterion A (description of scenario, rationale for product, success criteria, interview with client transcript)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sibauEAZz907iHk-InHE2HKZM4QbZ-UyN9qxDfIKTKQ/edit - criterion B (record of tasks, test plan, flow charts, models of the website interface and the database)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZ2VoHBPjOvCRByApemAsqbcpQ3XPEczgj4mFy-EV5A/edit - criterion C (code examples and thoughts about the algorithms I am using; will be edited to contain all the code in a structured way)
